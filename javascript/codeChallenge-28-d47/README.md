# Quick Sort

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.
Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

### big O space/time efficiency

The time efficiency is O(logn) because while looping each time you loop through the array, the loop gets smaller and smaller so it does not scale with n.
The space efficiency is O(n) because in the worst case scenario it will have to scale with n.
