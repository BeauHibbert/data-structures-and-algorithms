# Linked List
- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The efficiency for inserting an item into the list the efficency is O(1) because the 1 item is added at the beginning. For the includes and the toString, the efficency is O(n) because the worst case would be iterating through the whole linked list each time and it grows proportionally to n.
